I built a page that tells you fortune and your zodiac sign. When you go to the site you will get an alert with directions.
Initiially I needed to have the images shuffle and present themself when clickd.
Creating an array for my card images and a for loop to iterate and shuffle the images.
Setting an attribute to my image element for my placeholder card.
My two biggest issues were allowing only one card to be flipped at a time and showing the zodiac result.
I was able to press the face down card and get a single card shuffled. Now it only give you one and replaces card.
I could have made another array but I felt more comfortable doing if else statements. I'm fairly happy with the outcome.
Though I thought it was simple it gave me a run for my money.
